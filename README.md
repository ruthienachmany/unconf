This workshop/session is about movies & coding styles, patterns, and kickass abstractions. Finshed products, *apps*, and prototypes are what we use, read about, and teethe over, but the day-to-day making/building/running/testing of a project is, at times, frustrating, tedious, and vacuous (sometimes all at once). For some, including myself, coding was thought of as a means to an endâ€¦ an assumption that was wrong.

We'll also talk about pattern-matching, macros, types, closures, refactoring, and really making code *open-source*.

>Code by itself almost rots and it's gotta be rewritten. Even when nothing has changed, for some reason it rots.
